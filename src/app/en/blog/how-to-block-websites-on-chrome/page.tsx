            websites can help you stay focused on your tasks and achieve your
            goals more efficiently.

          <p>
            Follow these simple steps:
          </p>

          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
            <li>
              Install the extension from the{" "}

                Chrome store
              </a>
            </li>

            <li>
              Open the extension list in Chrome by clicking on the puzzle piece
              icon in the top right corner of your browser
              <Image
                loading={"lazy"}
                src={first}
                width={800}
                alt={"Open extension list"}
                className={"mt-2"}
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              Find the JustBlock extension and click on the pin icon to pin it
              to your browser toolbar for easy access
              <Image
                loading={"lazy"}
                src={second}
                width={800}
                className={"mt-2"}
                alt={"Pin the extension"}
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              Navigate to a website you want to block, click on the JustBlock
              extension icon, and select "Block current website"
              <Image
                loading={"lazy"}
                src={third}
                width={800}
                alt={"Block a website"}
                className={"mt-2"}
              />
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            That's it! The website will now be blocked. If you want to access
            the blocked website, you'll need to solve a captcha. This extra step
            helps you think twice before giving in to distractions, aligning
            with the concept of making bad habits harder to repeat, as discussed
            in the book "Atomic Habits."
